    <p>The experience during the internship was an experience that I will never forget because it all happened 
    without being planned properly. I and two other friends chose to do an internship at Uitm Seri Iskandar even though it is 
    far from our home. At that time, it was a challenge because our state was implementing PKP and was in the red zone. I 
    was apprehensive but still continued the steps to get there to undergo an internship. At first, I was very worried 
    and unsure of my decision, but when the internship period was over, I found it very difficult to leave the place. Many 
    unexpected things happened and gave me a thousand memories.

      <p>My shoes sole were torn off on the first day of internship. We entered the library for only 10 minutes,
       then broke back to college to change into other shoes and came back to the library. When we told to the librarian there,
       they laughed very hard at our situation at that time.</p>

      <p>Me and my friends had the opportunity to learn how to repair books, and we were able to repair the books ourselves.
